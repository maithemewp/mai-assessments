# Mai Assessments
Assessment management, scores, and results via WP Forms and ACF Pro.

## Usage
* Build assessment forms with likert fields via WP Forms plugin.
* Visit Dashboard > WPForms > Assessment Results to configure form results settings and content.
* Use `[mai_assessment_results]` shortcode to display all assessment results on a single page.
* Use `[mai_assessment_results id="456"]` to display results for a single form by ID.

## TODO
* Build custom block instead of shortcode for assessment results.
* Allow choosing forms from saved assessments (in the option value) to only show results for specific forms.
* Add a WYSIWYG field to allow specific text if there are no results (haven't taken the assessment yet).
